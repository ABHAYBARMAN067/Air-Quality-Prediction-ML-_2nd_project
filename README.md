# 🌫️ Air Quality Prediction App

A Streamlit-based web app that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** category using pollutant data like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and Temperature.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Predicts AQI using a trained **Random Forest Regressor**
- 🎯 Input pollutants and get real-time AQI category (e.g., Good, Poor, Hazardous)
- ⚙️ Built with **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, **joblib**
- 🔐 Clean and lightweight UI

## 📊 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (Machine Learning)
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib
